<h3>Technologies: HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript (vanila)</h3>

 <p>This was the very first website I ever made. I refactored it several times. For the sake of nostalgia, I decided not to improve the code further.</p>


 <h4>Functionality:</h4>
 <ul> 
  <li> Film Info</li>
  <li> Display the film trailer in a separate pop-up</li>
  <li> Display information about the film's main actors in a separate pop-up </li>
  <li> Gsap animation</li>
 </ul>
